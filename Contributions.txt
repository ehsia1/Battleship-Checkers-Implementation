Evan Hsia, ehsia1, Final Project Contributions

In this project, the three of us worked mostly collaboratively. We initially met up to come up with the basic design, the inheritance from game.h to battleship,
mobile, and checkers, and from piece.h to ships and checkers_piece. From there, we also made most of battleship, so we all knew the general idea of what to
do for the rest. I was the first to test battleship to see if it worked, and made a quick syntactic fix. Willie decided to begin the move function for mobile,
and Rohan made the driver, and I provided assistance for both. I drafted a lot of checkers at first, implementing a lot of functions. Willie and I made
sure to make it a little cleaner, and we worked off each other to finalize the checkers game, manipulating the attack_square function to actually work.
We both would take care of different fixes that we encountered through different run throughs. Meanwhile, Rohan worked on all three tester files, coming
up with enough play throughs of the three games involving a lot of different cases to test all the functions. We did a good job working off each other,
working together a lot, but dividing tasks when necessary.

In short, we did a good job of dividing the tasks evenly, and no single person carried a heavier load or did not pull his weight.
